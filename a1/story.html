		<p class="shot-text">Leading up to game 5 of the Eastern Conference First Round Series on May 7, the Cleveland Cavaliers entered the playoffs with a 57-25 season record while the Bulls had a 47-35 record. During the regular season, the Cavs were 6-0 against the Bulls. The Cavs were seeded 3rd, while the Bulls were seeded 6th. After a back and forth battle between the two teams, Michael Jordan hits a jumper with six seconds left to give the Bulls a 99-98 lead. Following a timeout by the Cavs, Craig Ehlo scored a layup giving the Cavs a 100-99 lead with only 3 seconds left. In the inbound play that followed, Jordan managed to get open, escaping a double team, and went for a jumper near the free throw line. The rest is history.
