		<p class="shot-text">Immediately after hitting the shot, Jordan celebrated by leaping into the air and swinging his arms in what later became an iconic moment. After pulling off the upset, the Bulls moved onto the second round of the playoffs as the sixth seed. This playoff series led to the start of the Chicago Bulls dynasty led by Michael Jordan. The game winning shot in this series became one of many game winning shots that Jordan will hit in his career. The Bulls advanced all the way to the Conference Finals before losing 2-4 to the Detroit Pistons who went on to win the championship in a sweep.
